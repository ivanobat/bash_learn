# Exercise

Folder content:
- CrimeStory.tar.gz
- README.md


## Motivation

Programming is learning by doing. CrimeStory is a fun way to learn the basic commands in shell, from navigating through the folders to extracting the information from text files. 


## Instructions 

Decompress the folder and read the **instruction** file for further details. I removed the solution file, but I will give it you at the end of the exercise, together with the source of the exercise.
